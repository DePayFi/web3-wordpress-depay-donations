== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does "P2P" mean? =
Another term we like to use is "wallet-to-wallet".
When someone sends you a crypto donation through your WordPress-based website via DePay, it goes directly from your supporter's wallet to your own wallet (this is referred to by the term "peer-to-peer" or "P2P"). There are no intermediaries in between, but smart contracts. These ensure that the payer can pay with any token on supported blockchains, whereupon the tokens are converted into the ones you want to receive.

= What are "Web3 payments"? =
Building on the idea that "Web3" is the next generation of a blockchain-based and therefore decentralized Internet, "Web3 payments" are a new type of P2P payments. Besides being decentralized and peer-to-peer, they are also characterized by being "permissionless" and not requiring you to trust ("trustless") in centralized entities such as intermediaries. Furthermore, Web3 payments are censorship-resistant. "Open source" code can often be an indicator of Web3 technologies. Read more on our [page about Web3 Payments](https://depay.fi/web3-payments).

= How does "on-the-fly" conversion work? =
* You configure which tokens you want to receive (e.g. USDT, BUSD) per blockchain
* Your supporters can send you donations with any token they currently have in their wallets (e.g. ETH or any other token)
* Once a transaction is sent, DePay's smart contracts convert the sender token (via decentralized liquidity pools such as Uniswap) into the tokens you have configured to be received. The payments arrive directly in your own wallet after the real-time conversion.
